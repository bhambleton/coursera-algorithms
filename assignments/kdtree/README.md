# KD-Trees



**The problem.** Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).


**Brute-force implementation.** Write a mutable data type PointSET.java that represents a set of points in the unit square.

**2d-tree implementation.** Write a mutable data type KdTree.java that uses a 2d-tree to implement the same API (but replace PointSET with KdTree). A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys. The idea is to build a BST with points in the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence.

The prime advantage of a 2d-tree over a BST is that it supports efficient implementation of range search and nearest-neighbor search. Each node corresponds to an axis-aligned rectangle in the unit square, which encloses all of the points in its subtree. The root corresponds to the unit square; the left and right children of the root corresponds to the two rectangles split by the x-coordinate of the point at the root; and so forth.
